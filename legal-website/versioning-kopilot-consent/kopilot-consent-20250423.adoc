I as the data subject hereby consent to the processing of my Personal Data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter: “GDPR”) and the EU AI Act, as follows:

Personal Data is any information which is related to an identified or identifiable natural person. The controller of Personal Data, alone or when joined with others, determines the purposes of any Personal Data and the means of processing it. VONQ B.V. (hereinafter: “VONQ”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is the operator of this website and applications (hereinafter: “CPA+"" and "Shortlist”)

For VONQ's CPA+: I consent to the collection, automated rating (scoring), and summarization of my personal data, which will be provided to clients (companies hiring) and sold as part of a package with other data sets containing Personal Data to companies hiring. I understand that this processing is necessary for the purpose of facilitating employment opportunities and that it will be conducted transparently, with appropriate safeguards to protect my rights and freedoms.

For VONQ's Shortlist: I consent to the collection, automated rating (scoring), and pre-screening of my personal data based on job requirements (such as, but not limited to, work permit and location). I agree that my Personal Data will only be forwarded and sold as part of a package with other data sets containing Personal Data to companies hiring, if my Personal Data matches the job requirements. I understand that this processing is necessary to match me with suitable employment opportunities and will be carried out with safeguards to ensure fairness, transparency, and compliance with applicable laws.

I confirm that my consent is freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. I have been informed of my rights under the GDPR, including the right to withdraw this consent at any time, the right to access, rectify, or erase my personal data, and the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. I understand that withdrawing my consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on this consent before its withdrawal.

This consent is provided voluntarily, and I have been informed about the purposes, scope, and consequences of the data processing, including the use of automated decision-making and profiling, in a clear and comprehensible manner.
